Make sure all screen sizes are responsive for what you are building. Alright for the frontend of this in the pages to be used as context, (I like the UI of the client repo site that uses javascript even tho I'm using typescript now, the main color of this project is that maroon color you would have seen in the manuscript pages, so you use variants of that if that's possible and design the pages creatively and intuitively). You'll first note that I'm not going to be using the cancel icon for the delete in the actions section I'd be using that that three dots that shows options and the options there are to assign faculty and to delete or remove the reviewer added or invited for the reviewers invitation or remove the author added or invited for the author invitations page, Now clicking on the assign faculty show bring up a modal, check how the modal will look like in the manuscript id page, I want something similar to the way it was designed there except this time you aren't assigning the assignedFaculty to the manuscript but to the user whether its the author or reviewer (should be able to change the assignedFaculty too after the first assigning), also if you need context on how the modal will be displayed without causing issues like freezing the screen well check that proposal page that's in the context folder, check how the resassign reviewers modal comes up and use it as context. then the second option to delete the user added well it does it job, but for the reviewer you can't delete a reviewer that has been assigned a manuscript to review tho, for the author you can't delete an author if the author has an article connected to the author. meaning their article has been published. So those are the three pages to be sent the reviewer invitations page, the author invitations page both of them following similar logic and then the author's page (using the researcher's page as context) which has the options to let you view the details of the authors and send credentials to those who haven't been sent and resend the credentials too when the need arises (you should note that both authors with manuscript and those without will be displayed here so know how the view details will be handled conditionally I think by default those authors who were added or invited and doesn't have manuscripts you'll see that they'll have the resend credentials option since their credentials have been sent before when being added or accepting the invite, (This even reminds me I don't know if I've said these before but you can only assign faculty to those who have accepted the invite or were added so that's only when the option should be visible)). But I want you to design the page more creatively and intuitively (The forms to add reviewers and authors in the add reviewer for the reviewer invitation page and the add authors in the authors invitation page should follow what's in the backend). don't forget I want it to be responsive for all screen sizes with no layout issues too. Think and reason carefully.
